# Tweed Fedora

## Overview
This is my personal tweaked version of Fedora Linux--Tweed Fedora. Get it! 🤠

This project will help me as I am constantly reinstalling fedora system. The time it takes to setup without this script is immensly shortened. 

I created this script in Fedora 41. It will probably work on Latest Versions as well.

I will be working on this project as a hobby. Anyone, who wants to contribute or provide ideas is welcome.  

Bug Report will immensely help me develop this project. 

## Features
This script installs and sets up variety of things, from setting up dotfiles, installing extensions, setting up power profiles to creating custom keyboard shortcuts. 

This script is created to be run on freshly installed Fedora with Gnome.
